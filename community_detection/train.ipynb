(maybe i'm being too literal here. ahem.)\n",
                        "i get along really well with people who are many kinds of high (though i tend to be almost straightedge). why is this private? several times i have found myself at a party where i know a couple of people but i seem to get along really, really well with everyone - they seem to be a lot more like me than most people are, more friendly, talkative, and upbeat than usual, and less rigid, self-absorbed, or uptight. and i have thought to myself, \"these are my people. i feel at home with these people, like just another one of many rather than someone who is always a little bit different.\" when it becomes clear, later, either because someone makes it obvious or perhaps a party-goer later mentions that the reason why people seemed different that night from how they have been since is because just about everyone else was high before i got there, it makes me wonder - if i think those folks are like me, what am i like?  in the end, though, i realize it's just a thing i have to come to terms with: i, like so many of you reading this, am just a little bit different from most people - we're all unique individuals, certainly, and although some of us may seem to be a bit more unique, for some reason, the fact remains that this is the life you have and your best option is to live it as well as you can. so be it!\n",
                        "you think you're smart, interesting, heartful, curious, or fun to spend an afternoon with. i'm looking to expand my circle of people that i connect really well with, or even just find more folks who like to do new things & have more fun than they probably should (according to their more boring friends).  i admit (as you'll know, if you've read the foregoing), i'm not short of friends & people i'm currently not sending postcards to or calling, so if we don't get along pretty well pretty quickly then it might not work out, but i reckon it's worth coffee or cocoa to find out.  also - please message me if you have any suggestions for books or music, either because you think i'd like them for some reason or because you think so highly of something that you reckon everyone should take a gander at it. double bonus if you can give a precis of content - in fact, i'd be really impressed. i'm still working on that for my own reference (helps me remember themes, details, outcomes).  lastly, please don't be offended if you im or message me and it's a little while before i get back to you - for one thing, see above re: responding to mail, but also i have firefox's okc plugin, so it looks like i'm online all the time, regardless of where i am. i'm (probably) not ignoring you, i'm just not there.\n",
