      "i'm very honest & straightforward, both with you & with me, so i tend to know what i'm about and i don't mind telling you how i'm feeling. i like people who are communicative & functional - i don't want to have to guess what's wrong, i want you to tell me, and if you're happy i'd like to hear about it. i'm easy to get along with, probably largely because i'm not very demanding and i am very forgiving - i'm appreciative of the things that work out between us and i understand that sometimes things just don't quite go as planned. so you're late, or you have to cancel something, or you're grumpy in the mornings - so what? i take everyone with a grain of salt, and i don't tend to take anything too seriously.  i like to see people i care about as often as i can, but whether that translates to once a month or twice a week is fine. some people are busy, some aren't - live your life how you want to, and i'll be happy if we can do so together. i might really love spending time with you, but i'm not going to hold it against you if you're working on a 60-hour week. likewise, i don't want you to freak out if all of a sudden i have a lot of extra work & we don't see each other as much for a while.  this is hilarious, btw - http://tinyurl.com/223fms-enneagram - it assigned me accurately, and the descriptions are (mostly) pretty solid. take it yourself: http://tinyurl.com/okc-quick-painless-enneagram - it might be enlightening.  p.s. i should apparently be somewhere between 6'4\" & 6'6\" according to the okc's analysis of how people post height - but then i should be making \"$100k+\" as well, so what the hell.\n",
      "i'm in transition, changing career paths from database administration to data analysis, working on getting better qualified for consulting & analyst positions. for now, my lackluster cover letters (or my terrible resume? no one really knows) have so far kept me cheerfully tuning queries & tables instead.  on a personal level, i'm mostly trying to pull it all together - build a coherent practice, be a better friend to people i care about (by replying to their messages more often and more promptly, by being on time more often), be more organized & effective in my life (keep everything filed & up to date, keep my personal space more tidy than not). it's a process - i'm always working on something, some aspect of me that i feel i can improve. i have very high standards for me, even as i don't expect too much from others, and sometimes i feel like every time i get everything dealt with, something else pops up that i never noticed before. maybe it's a refining process, and i'm dealing with it all sequentially, but i doubt it - i think i'm just human, & doing my best to do a good job at living my life.  for business/career self-improvement, i'm teaching myself to use a couple of statistical packages & reading textbooks on business/process optimization theory (bring it on, nerds), and to help make my inside vision match my outside world, i read psychology & behavioral economics books (mostly popular/mass market, actual textbooks less often). i re-read this paragraph and i think it makes me sound like a dork, but there you go - either the rest of the profile shows that i'm not, or i just suck at describing my life. we'll see.\n",
      "empathy, forgiveness, welding, procrastinating, mountain biking, copy editing, endurance sports, changing everything from the inside out, remaining very still for long periods of time, making foods whose main ingredients are cocoa products, channeling, speaking with the spirits (am i serious? am i kidding?), loving, kissing, listening, negotiating, and breathing (you try it - it's not always so easy).  i could use some improvement at: separating essential from inessential (i once got to the airport without a passport because i was too focused on which wallet it went in), allowing enough time for contingencies and emergencies (i'm working on it - see above), keeping in touch with people i like (it's not even \"out of sight, out of mind\" - i think about them all the time, i just never let them know; again, working on it), writing concise sentences without excessive or semi-irrelevant detail (essential ... inessential ... it's time for the end of this sentence).\n",
      "an off-beat sense of humor, an overall sense of relaxed composure, a wry smile, and my excellent dress sense. if by \"excellent\", it is understood that i mean \"encompassing the well-bred gentleman's ideals of bespoke suits cut and blended with '50s loungewear and occasionally clothes from the '70s that are clearly a cruel joke perpetrated on an unsuspecting and unfashionable public.\" why, you might ask? why on earth do you ever willingly, knowingly, wear polyester? because you can't wear clothes that even a retired, color-blind golfer in florida would find embarrassing without bringing a feeling into the room that maybe more fun should be being had right now. maybe you have to be there, but it's true - although you wouldn't find this out for a while after we met, if we met, because i find the opposite effect to be in force in casual first encounters: it's just too hard to get past the plaid.  regardless of what people notice, they often like me for no apparent reason, pretty much right off the bat (maybe there are factors neither i nor they are aware of, but it usually seems like people like me basically just because i'm there - it's almost weird, except that's just how it is; my current theory is that i make people feel good about themselves because i'm very non-judgmental and because i see the good parts first, and the bad parts often only much later; thus, seeing themselves reflected as though through a glass, brightly, perhaps they think to themselves, \"who is this jovial fellow, this man amongst men, this keen-eyed rogue who sees me as the princely soul i am?\").  i really have got to do something about the parentheticals - footnotes would look stupid, so clearly drastic cuts are in order. for now, suck it up until i fix it, wiki-edit it, or send me hate mail about how terrible it is - i'll be impressed you read this far down the page, either way. well done you! there will be a quiz at the bottom.\n",
      "i like to read mind-bending fiction (e.g. philip k. dick, some borges, even huxley) that takes you to another mental place entirely, i'll watch any movie that makes me feel different after i've seen it, and i'll eat just about anything (not beets - i love their flavor, but it would seem that i'm allergic to them; think 'exorcist,' or actually, don't).  specifically, i love southern food in all its incarnations, especially collards, beans, & gumbo. i like fried cheese (it sounds terrible, i know, but it's actually good for you if you fry it in grapeseed oil, because it's better for you than cheese fat, & frying the cheese sort of clarifies it - plus, it's delicious if you crisp the cheese on the outside & serve it on crostini with tomato salsa) and all sorts of things that aren't supposed to be very good for you (no junk food, though - processed foods never taste or feel that good to me). i could eat roast vegetables every day, and fried collard greens with bacon & peppers five times a week.  the last movies i saw in a theater were mulholland drive (don't judge me, it was a retrospective), which i still find to be quite thought-provoking, and john carter, which i enjoyed largely because the 3d was excellent & because i'm a long-time fan of edgar rice burroughs. it doesn't belong in 'films,' but i'm so exceedingly amused by the venture brothers series on adult swim that i'm putting it here anyway. i would date someone solely because they liked watching the venture brothers and futurama with me, although i don't know how long that would last (about seventy episodes, i guess).  i don't have favorite music, just music that i listen to a lot at a given time. once i start listening to an artist or a genre, i get everything i can in that vein and listen it to death or until something else catches my fancy. at the moment, it's led zeppelin crossed with bootleg live fatboy slim & aphex twin mixes, ambient dub, and noise (that last is new - i'm not really feeling it yet, but it comes recommended so i'm giving it time). i also like grime & uk dubstep imports, but as i say that i realize it's getting harder & harder to find good dubstep, as there's so much tat put out by labels who are capitalizing on a stereotype of the sound but not really encapsulating the feeling.\n",
      "parenthetical remarks (judging by the above as samples). the company and contact of people i like. kisses, touching, etc. exercise, fresh air, and a change of scenery. options - i hate being boxed in. sunscreen (most of the time). time to think & reflect, or to feel & respond to the moment.  (does anyone count these six things? message or im me if someone has ever corrected your seven-list, or grammar, or punctuation - i'm just curious, because i sometimes get the urge to fix someone's comma splices or obvious misspellings and malaprops, but then i think to myself that if it mattered to them, they'd run the spellchecker before submitting it, and then i'm just the fastidious idiot fussing over nothing).\n",
      "neurological functions (synapse repair & proliferation, neurotransmitter pathways, how to make my brain work better & smarter).  what i'm going to do with the rest of my life (what i want to do for money, where i want to be, physically & otherwise, in 5 years, how to live in such a way that when i look back at 85 i'm happy with my choices).  now - or rather, not thinking about now, but being in it.\n",
      "swing dancing at a ballroom, or at a bar or a show with friends. i don't tend to drink much, but i tend to like hanging out with people who do (go figure), so it works out well enough anyway.  as an aside, i'm amused at how many people won't admit to having a \"typical friday night\" to write about -- at a certain level, i think it bespeaks a little bit of denial (that you're as knowable as everyone else) or perhaps a lack of self-knowledge/self-examination if you can't look back & recognize your patterns; contrariwise, if you truly have no patterns, that is in itself a little odd to me. i don't mind if your pattern is \"go out & do something that i've never done before\" or even \"write a numbered list of the top results from a google search of sf activities this weekend ... and then roll a 20-sided die\" but i suspect if you actually look at your life, there probably is a pattern.  (maybe i'm being too literal here. ahem.)\n",
      "i get along really well with people who are many kinds of high (though i tend to be almost straightedge). why is this private? several times i have found myself at a party where i know a couple of people but i seem to get along really, really well with everyone - they seem to be a lot more like me than most people are, more friendly, talkative, and upbeat than usual, and less rigid, self-absorbed, or uptight. and i have thought to myself, \"these are my people. i feel at home with these people, like just another one of many rather than someone who is always a little bit different.\" when it becomes clear, later, either because someone makes it obvious or perhaps a party-goer later mentions that the reason why people seemed different that night from how they have been since is because just about everyone else was high before i got there, it makes me wonder - if i think those folks are like me, what am i like?  in the end, though, i realize it's just a thing i have to come to terms with: i, like so many of you reading this, am just a little bit different from most people - we're all unique individuals, certainly, and although some of us may seem to be a bit more unique, for some reason, the fact remains that this is the life you have and your best option is to live it as well as you can. so be it!\n",
      "you think you're smart, interesting, heartful, curious, or fun to spend an afternoon with. i'm looking to expand my circle of people that i connect really well with, or even just find more folks who like to do new things & have more fun than they probably should (according to their more boring friends).  i admit (as you'll know, if you've read the foregoing), i'm not short of friends & people i'm currently not sending postcards to or calling, so if we don't get along pretty well pretty quickly then it might not work out, but i reckon it's worth coffee or cocoa to find out.  also - please message me if you have any suggestions for books or music, either because you think i'd like them for some reason or because you think so highly of something that you reckon everyone should take a gander at it. double bonus if you can give a precis of content - in fact, i'd be really impressed. i'm still working on that for my own reference (helps me remember themes, details, outcomes).  lastly, please don't be offended if you im or message me and it's a little while before i get back to you - for one thing, see above re: responding to mail, but also i have firefox's okc plugin, so it looks like i'm online all the time, regardless of where i am. i'm (probably) not ignoring you, i'm just not there.\n",
